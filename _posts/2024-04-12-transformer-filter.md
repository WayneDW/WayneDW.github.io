TBD 

This blog is a summarization of the work [xx].

The analysis is twofold.


The first step shows that a self-attention block can exactly represent the Gaussian kernel smoothing (GKS) estimator.

The second step shows the GKS estimator approximates the Kalman filter by tuning the temperature variable.
