The classical Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge Problem (SBP) have found interesting applications in deep generative models. The iterative nature in solving this problem shows a great potential to further accelerate the training for score-based generative models, although the later is already the state-of-the-art methods [\[Image Generation on CIFAR-10\]](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-generation-on-cifar-10).

The most striking feature of this algorithm is its deep mathematical connections to stochastic optimal control, optimal transport, fluid dynamics, and DNN approximations. A such, we have sufficient tools to address understand the underlying theories. The following is a short note to summarize this problem: [\[A short introduction on SBP\]](https://github.com/WayneDW/Notes/blob/master/SBP_problem.pdf).
