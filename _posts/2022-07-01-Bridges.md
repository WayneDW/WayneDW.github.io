The classical Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge Problem (SBP) have found interesting applications in generative models and deep learning. The iterative nature shows a potential to further accelerate the training based on score-based generative models.

The most striking feature of this algorithm is its deep mathematical connections to stochastic optimal control, optimal transport, and fluid dynamics.

The following is a short note to summarize this problem [link](https://github.com/WayneDW/Notes/blob/master/SBP_problem.pdf).
