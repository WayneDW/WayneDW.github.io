A coupling of two random variables/ vectors represents a joint distribution, where the marginal distributions are denoted by $p$ and $q$, respectively. Any joint distributions of $p$ and $q$ define a valid coupling. Although there are infinitely many of them, some of them are quite special and may facilitate our analysis.
