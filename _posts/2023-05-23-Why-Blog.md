I was captivated by the elegant mathematical formulas that describe the laws of the universe and the human world. However, I found myself overwhelmed by the multitude of essential tools in differential equations, analysis, algebra, and geometry. I was on the verge of giving up until I came across a series of enlightening slides and blogs that brought clarity to my thoughts. I made the decision to embark on this journey and contribute to the community.


### A Self-Reflection of Understanding

Feynman ever said that 

```
What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand.
```

Many intriguing formulas and theorems may seem deceptively simple solely based on their names, but their true essence is revealed when we meticulously write them down and analyze their intricacies step by step. Maintaining a blog not only helps me organize my thoughts but also allows me to delve deeper into my understanding.



### Knowledge Sharing

I am not generating new knowledge, but rather devoted to disseminating the seldom-explored paths discovered by others. I believe that valuable pathways deserve acknowledgment from a broader audience through various mediums like textbooks, publications, and blogs. Over the course of China's millennia-long history, countless invaluable customs have been lost simply due to insufficient awareness.
