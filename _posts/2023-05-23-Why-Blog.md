During the early stages of my Ph.D. career, I found myself overwhelmed as I delved into the intricate and enigmatic connections found within stochastic differential equations, partial differential equations, dynamical systems, functional analysis, and geometry. I was on the verge of giving up until I came across a series of enlightening slides and blogs that brought clarity to my thoughts. 



### A Self-Reflection of Understanding

Feynman ever said that 

> What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand.

Many intriguing formulas and theorems may seem deceptively simple solely based on their names, but their true essence is revealed when we meticulously write them down and analyze their intricacies step by step. Maintaining a blog not only helps me organize my thoughts but also allows me to delve deeper into my understanding.



### Knowledge Sharing

I am not generating new knowledge, but rather devoted to disseminating the seldom-explored paths discovered by others. I believe that valuable pathways deserve acknowledgment from a broader audience through various mediums like textbooks, publications, and blogs. Over the course of China's millennia-long history, countless invaluable customs have been lost simply due to insufficient awareness.
