We propose the contour stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for Bayesian learning in big data statistics. The proposed algorithm is essentially a **scalable dynamic importance sampler**, which automatically **flattens** the target distribution such that the simulation for a multi-modal distribution can be greatly facilitated. Theoretically, we prove a stability condition and establish the asymptotic convergence of the self-adapting parameter to a **unique fixed-point**; we also present an error analysis for the weighted averaging estimators.
