A long standing technique for variance reduction is the control variates method. The key to reducing the variance is to properly design correlated control variates so as to counteract some noise. Towards this direction, Dubey'16 and Xu'18 proposed to update the control variate periodically for the stochastic gradient estimators and Baker'19 studied the construction of control variates using local modes. Despite the advantages in near-convex problems, a natural discrepancy between theory and practice is whether we should avoid the gradient noise in non-convex problems. To fill in the gap, we only focus on the variance reduction of noisy energy estimators to exploit the theoretical accelerations but no longer consider the variance reduction of the noisy gradients so that the empirical experience from stochastic gradient descents with momentum (M-SGD) can be naturally imported.
