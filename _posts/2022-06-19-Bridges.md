The classical Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP) have found interesting applications in deep generative models [2,3] and financial trading strategies [4]. The iterative nature in solving this problem shows a great potential to further accelerate the training for score-based generative models, although the later is already the state-of-the-art methods [\[Image Generation\]](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-generation-on-cifar-10).

The most striking feature of this algorithm is its deep mathematical connections to stochastic optimal control, optimal transport, fluid dynamics, and DNN approximations. As such, we have sufficient tools to understand the underlying theories. The following is a short note to summarize this problem: [\[A short introduction on SBP\]](https://github.com/WayneDW/Notes/blob/master/SBP_problem.pdf).
