The classical Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP) have found interesting applications in deep generative models {% cite Nea11 %}, {% cite forward_backward_SDE %}, {% cite DSB %} and financial mathematics {% cite nutz_trading %} {% cite nutz_portfolio %} {% cite schrodinger_vol_model %}. The iterative nature in solving this problem shows a great potential to further accelerate the training for score-based generative models, although the later is already the state-of-the-art methods [\[Image Generation\]](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-generation-on-cifar-10).

The most striking feature of this algorithm is its deep mathematical connections to stochastic optimal control, optimal transport, fluid dynamics {% cite siam_review_Sinkhorn_liaisons %}, and DNN approximations. As such, we have sufficient tools to understand the underlying theories. We refer interested readers to the Appendix A of {% cite provably_schrodinger_bridge %}.
