Poincare Inequality or spectral gap inequality is the first important family of functional inequalities that charaterizes the exponential convergence of a random variable towards the equilibrium.

If a Markov Triple satisfies a Poincare equality P(C), we can expect an exponential decay of the variance for any function f

$\text{Var}_{\mu}(P_t f)\leq e^{-2t/C} Var_{\mu}(f)$, 

where $P_t$ is a Markov semigroup with the unique invariant distribution $\mu$.

Despite the appealing formulation, identifying the 

In this blog, we will show a popular method for determining 

$e^{i \pi} = -1$
