Linear regression

large n > small d
small n < large d

Minimum-norm estimator 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10939.pdf

why the pseudo-inverse (check this slide: https://ds12.github.io/talks/lectures/lecture4.html#slide16, page ) linear regression corresponds to the solution with minimum norm.


singular value decomposition and/or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.


TBD
