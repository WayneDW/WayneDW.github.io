I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Applied Mathematics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/science/) working with [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/) and [Faming Liang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~fmliang/). Prior to my graduate study, I was a senior software engineer at Baidu (2012-2015) and got my bachelor degree in Information and Computing Science at [BJTU](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) in 2012.

My research focuses on scalable Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian inference for problems arising in deep learning. My specialties include robust uncertainty estimates, enhanced ensemble techniques, and sparse deep learning with theoretical guarantees. 

The algorithms show potential in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems, and quantitative finance.
