I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Applied Mathematics, Purdue University. My research focuses on scalable Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian inference for problems arising in deep learning. My specialties include robust uncertainty estimates, enhanced ensemble techniques, and sparse deep learning with theoretical guarantees. The algorithms show potential in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems, and quantitative finance.
