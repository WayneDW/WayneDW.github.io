I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/science/) working with Prof. [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/) and [Faming Liang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~fmliang/). My research focuses on **scalable Monte Carlo methods** and **uncertainty quantification** for problems arising in deep learning. 

<!--- My interests include uncertainty quantification, non-convex optimization, feature selection, and reinforcement learning with theory and applications. -->

Before that, I was a research intern at [Yahoo research](https://research.yahoo.com/), Sunnyvale (Summer 2019) and a senior research engineer at [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/) (2012-2015). I got a bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science at [BJTU](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) in 2012.
