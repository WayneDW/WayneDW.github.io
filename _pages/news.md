<!-- Apr, 2025. -->

Apr, 2025. Invited Talk at [Practitioners’ Seminar 2025](https://www.math.columbia.edu/mafn/practitioners-seminar-2025/) at Columbia University, hosted by Dr. [Jae. Choi](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaehyukchoi_columbiamafn-ai-finance-activity-7321219854013771777-D4-R?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABKzGL4B8FfIjDA0z1I1nRH9z0QifCSygNQ)

Jan, 2025. 2 AISTATS on diffusion generative models are accpeted!

Jan, 2025. 1 [JCGS](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2024.2380051) is accpeted. Federated HMC can be faster than Federated Langevin dynamics.

Nov, 2024. Invited Talk at [Learning Meets Geometry, Graphs, and Networks
](https://logmeetupnyc.github.io/), NY

Apr, 2024. [Variational Schrödinger Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04795) is accepted by ICML'24! Schrödinger diffusion is scalable now by linearizing the forward scores. Simulation-free property is all we need for scalability.

Apr, 2024. [Reflected Schrödinger Bridge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03228) is accepted by UAI'24 as **Oral**. Reflected Schrödinger has the linear convergence of couplings via entropic optimal transport on bounded domains.

Apr, 2024. 2 ICML, 2 UAI (+1 Oral) and 1 AISTAT are accpeted!
